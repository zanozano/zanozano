### Hi, I'm Cris 👋 👨‍💻


## About me
I have always been interested in the interaction between physical and digital products and how they interact with people's needs. As a professional, I manage every project from a different and innovative point-of-views to improve the user experience design, getting a positive impact on their needs. I am specialized in agile methodologies and Mechanical 3D Models.

I am a passionate professional with my work, cheerful and empathetic. Moreover, I can lead and work with multidisciplinary teams.
